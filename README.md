# Inheritance
Using video game characters I work with the concept of inheritance in C++

What I Learned:
- Define syntactically correct classes that use inheritance in accordance with good programming practice.
- Explain and Implement constructors and initialization lists in the context of inheritance.
- Explain and implement polymorphism, virtual functions, abstract base classes, and pure virtual functions.
